## Why Docker
- Multi billion dollar companies are using or adapting Docker (ebay, netflix, sky ...)
- Docker adoption increased 50% in 2020

## Docker vs VM
- Docker is light weight and user friendly
- Docker shares the resource of OS as opposed to using the OS completely
- Docker engine connects the container with OS and only use the resources required.
- VM works with hypervisor to connect guest OS/VM with host OS/VM.
